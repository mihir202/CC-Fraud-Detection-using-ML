# CC-Fraud-Detection-using-ML

Applying a dataset of almost 28,500 credit card transactions(KAGGLE) and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are working to recognize transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud.   

In this project, the following two machine learning algorithms:  

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

Isolation Forest Algorithm
